:::

The goal of my work is the re-use of routine care data to add value to the healthcare process. 

Previously I was at the [University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU)](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/center-for-translational-immunology) and University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), where I managed a large database with clinical and laboratory data on kidney transplants. I made this data easily available for other researchers, enriched it with new information, and analyzed and visualized the data to deliver new insights. I also built diagnostic models of auto-immune and auto-inflammatory disorders, using information from the electronic health record extracted with text mining techniques.

Before switching to data science in the medical domain, I was a PhD student in the [Cognition and Plasticity lab](https://www.heleenslagter.com/) of Prof. Heleen Slagter, funded by an NWO Research Talent grant. [My PhD research](https://lcreteig.github.io/thesis) focused on improving  attention through electrical stimulation of the brain. During my PhD I became a strong supporter of open science principles, and I still strive to make my work as accessible, transparent, and reproducible as possible.
