    Attention allows us to focus on what is relevant and to ignore what is
    not. While we call upon attention at every waking moment, it is not
    static: we cannot sustain attention indefinitely, and often fall prey to
    distractions. This PhD thesis is a study of the short-term
    *neuroplasticity* of attentional processes: how susceptible is attention
    to change, and what processes in the brain (*neuro*-) give rise to
    changes in attention (-*plasticity*)? In Chapters 2–5, I examined
    whether attention can be improved with electrical stimulation of the
    brain, in the form of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS).
    Previous studies that attempted to use tDCS to enhance attention have
    yielded promising, but inconsistent results (reviewed in Chapter 2). My
    attempt to enhance *spatial* attention with tDCS (Chapter 3) was
    unsuccessful, as stimulation of the frontal eye fields did not lead to
    changes in eye movements. Applying tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal
    cortex also did not enhance *temporal* attention (Chapters 4 and 5), as
    participants’ performance on an attentional blink task remained
    unchanged. In Chapter 6, I investigated the opposite effect: decreases
    in attention, when attention has to be *sustained* for a long time.
    Using EEG, I tracked whether similar decreases occurred in different
    attention-related signals in the brain. tDCS may one day be used to
    counteract these declines, or to relieve other deficits in attention.
    However, barring a deeper understanding of the technique and more
    large-scale studies of its efficacy, such practical applications of tDCS
    are not yet feasible.
